# The pdn-soundmodem guide

pdn-soundmodem is a software TNC for Linux. It turns a sound card, a FlexRadio or a public web receiver into a packet modem, speaks KISS over TCP to your node or APRS software, runs ARDOP for Winlink and POCSAG paging, and shows the band in a browser. This guide is for the operator setting one up. Read it in order the first time, or pick a task from the list below. Every page says what to do and what you should see; the keys, flags, ports and files behind it are in the reference pages at the end.

## Reading order

1. [01-install.md](01-install.md): install the package on Debian, Ubuntu or Raspberry Pi OS, and see what it put where.
2. [02-first-station.md](02-first-station.md): one AFSK 1200 modem decoding APRS off air, on the station page, with your software attached.
3. [03-radios-and-interfaces.md](03-radios-and-interfaces.md): which `device` string and `ptt` block your sound card, interface, FlexRadio or web receiver needs.
4. [04-levels.md](04-levels.md): set the receive gain from the level meter and the transmit audio with a test tone.
5. [05-modes.md](05-modes.md): every mode, what it talks to, and how well proven it is.
6. [06-connect-your-software.md](06-connect-your-software.md): KISS over TCP, LinBPQ, APRS clients, ARDOP for Pat and Winlink Express, and paging.
7. [07-station-page.md](07-station-page.md): every control, panel and badge on the browser page.
8. [08-hf.md](08-hf.md): place modems on an HF band by RF frequency and let the modem tell you the dial.
9. [09-web-receivers.md](09-web-receivers.md): decode packet off a public web receiver with no radio at all.
10. [10-public-monitor.md](10-public-monitor.md): put your station on a monitor site, or run one.
11. [11-logging-and-metrics.md](11-logging-and-metrics.md): the frame log, survey captures, raw capture, Prometheus and Grafana.
12. [12-troubleshooting.md](12-troubleshooting.md): read the journal, the start-up refusals, and what to do when nothing decodes.
13. [13-decode-a-recording.md](13-decode-a-recording.md): get the frames out of a WAV file with the source-tree tools.

The two hardware pages are what to build to wire a CM108 interface to a radio: [hardware/tait-tm8100-cm108.md](hardware/tait-tm8100-cm108.md) for a Tait TM8100 on FM, and [hardware/yaesu-ft450d-cm108.md](hardware/yaesu-ft450d-cm108.md) for a Yaesu FT-450D's DATA jack on HF.
