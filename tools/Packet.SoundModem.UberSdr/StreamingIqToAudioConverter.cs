/// audio out, in constant memory and at a fraction of the arithmetic.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Why this exists.</b> The whole-file converter allocates six arrays the length of the
/// capture and runs a 301-tap complex FIR at the <em>input</em> rate. An hour of iq48 is 172.8 M
/// complex samples — several 1.4 GB <c>double[]</c> and 14 M complex MACs per second of capture.
/// It exhausts memory well before it becomes slow. Campaign passes are hour-long by design (the
/// receiver's <c>max_session_time</c>), so the whole-file path cannot be the one that scores
/// them.</para>
/// <para><b>What makes it cheap.</b> The reference chain is: NCO → complex SSB bandpass (<c>h</c>,
/// 301 taps) → take the real part → real anti-alias low-pass (<c>g</c>, 41 taps) → keep 1 in 5.
/// Because <c>g</c> is real, <c>g * Re{y} = Re{g * y}</c>, so the two filters can be collapsed
/// into a single complex kernel <c>e = h * reverse(g)</c> of 341 taps whose real part is taken at
/// the very end. That kernel is then evaluated <em>only at output instants</em> — decimating
/// filters cost taps-per-output, not taps-per-input — which is 341 complex MACs per 9600 Hz
/// output against 301 per 48000 Hz input plus the low-pass, a little over 4× less work. Nothing
/// is approximated: this is the same linear filter, evaluated where its result is wanted.</para>
/// <para>The output is sample-for-sample the reference converter's, to within double-versus-float
/// rounding, and a test asserts exactly that — the two implementations are not allowed to drift
/// apart. <see cref="IqToAudioOptions.NormalisePeak"/> is deliberately <em>not</em> honoured here:
/// peak-normalising needs the whole file, and scaling a capture to whichever burst happened to be
/// loudest is not something a scorer should do behind the operator's back. Level is the caller's
/// to choose.</para>
