/// <c>docs/ms110d/tables/text-layer-extracts.md</c>): generator x⁹+x⁴+1, 9-bit register
/// initialized to 1 at the start of each data frame. PSK symbols are scrambled by modulo-8
/// addition of the numerical value of the rightmost three register bits; 2^N-QAM symbols XOR
/// the rightmost N bits. The register iterates <b>after</b> use, so the first symbol of every
/// data frame is scrambled by the initialization value 000000001.

/// <remarks>
/// Register convention (Figure D-6 is an image page; the convention follows the printed
/// D.5.1.4 trinomial C code from the same standard, which shifts toward higher indices with
/// feedback into index 0 and reads the output from the lowest indices): bits b[8..0] live in
/// an int with b[i] at bit i; one iteration is
/// <c>b0' = b8 ⊕ b4</c> (the x⁹ and x⁴ taps), everything else shifting up. The rightmost
/// three bits are (b2 b1 b0) with b2 the MSB, exactly as the trinomial's
/// <c>(bitshift[2]&lt;&lt;2)+(bitshift[1]&lt;&lt;1)+bitshift[0]</c>. This convention is
/// loopback-blind (checklist L3); the wire-side unit test pins the hand-computed sequence
