/// <c>/rig-window</c> (issue #585, step 2 of the one-receiver plan, packet-net/pdn-mailcast#75):
/// a program on the same machine asks this station to retune its rig and hold all transmitting
/// for a while, then puts everything back. Built on the same <see cref="RigControl.Tune"/> window
/// and <see cref="RigControl.HoldsTransmitter"/> hold the built-in mailcast receiver's own
/// retuner uses, generalised so any local program can ask for it - nothing here is
/// mailcast-specific.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>The request handling without the HTTP</b>, the same split <c>TxLeaseApi</c> and
/// <c>RigApi</c> keep in the daemon: <see cref="WaterfallWebServer"/> checks the remote address
/// and the <c>Origin</c> header, reads the body and writes the answer, and everything else is
/// here, so a test can reach it with a fake clock and no listener.</para>
/// <para><b>Loopback only, no key.</b> The same rule as the channel audio stream (issue #584,
/// <see cref="ChannelAudioStream"/>): refused unless the request's remote address is loopback,
/// and refused if it carries an <c>Origin</c> header at all. There is nobody to tell two local
/// callers apart, so they share the one window a station offers - the same owner name is used
/// whoever asks, and a second local caller's request behaves exactly as a renewal or a refusal of
/// the first one would, through <see cref="RigControl.Tune"/>'s own owner check.</para>
/// <para><b>The mode is never asked for.</b> This station's own <see cref="RigControl.Plan"/>
/// names its own data mode (PKTUSB and the like) if it has a USB-family one; otherwise plain USB
/// is asked for. A caller cannot name a mode, unlike the keyed <c>/api/rig/tune</c>.</para>
/// <para><b>The transmit lease.</b> Refused while a <see cref="TransmitLease"/> is held, so a
/// listener's receive window and a head end's broadcast lease can never both be granted; the
/// daemon's <c>TxLeaseApi</c> is the other half, refusing a lease while this window is open.</para>
/// <para><b>Bounded and self-ending.</b> Every window this opens is capped at
/// <see cref="RigControl.MaxWindow"/> (5 minutes) the same as <c>/api/rig/tune</c>; a caller that
/// stops renewing, or vanishes, is a window that simply runs out and puts the rig back on its
/// own - there is no separate "client disconnected" signal to wire up, because there is no
/// connection to notice losing: each request is a plain HTTP round trip.</para>
/// <para><b>Never a Flex.</b> A <c>rig</c> section is refused on a <c>flex:</c> device
/// (<c>DaemonConfig.ValidateRig</c>), so a Flex station has no <see cref="RigControl"/> at all and
/// this path 404s on one exactly as <c>/api/rig</c> and <c>/api/rig/tune</c> already do.</para>
