/// The local channel audio stream (issue #584): a WebSocket on the station page server that
/// hands a program on the same machine the channel's receive audio, nothing else. One receive
/// tap fans out to every connection, each with its own small bounded queue; a slow reader loses
/// blocks, marked with a gap, rather than slowing the modem or any other reader.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Loopback only, no key.</b> The server checks the request with
/// <see cref="LocalProgramRefusal"/> before accepting the upgrade; this class assumes that has
/// already happened and serves anything handed to it.</para>
/// <para><b>100 ms blocks.</b> The channel's own blocks are whatever the station reads (100 ms,
/// or 20 ms with an ARDOP modem), so the audio is gathered here into blocks of a tenth of a
/// second, once for every connection. A block is shorter than that only where the transmitted
/// flag changes, or where the input lost audio: each block is wholly one or the other, and a gap
/// always starts a new one.</para>
/// <para><b>Keyed blocks.</b> <see cref="SoundModemChannel.ProcessReceive"/> skips every receive
/// tap while the channel is transmitting (half duplex), so an ordinary tap simply sees nothing
/// for the length of a keyup. <see cref="OnKeyedBlock"/> is wired to
/// <see cref="SoundModemChannel.KeyedReceiveBlock"/> instead, which fires from exactly that gate
/// with the length of the block that was skipped - silence of the same length, marked
/// transmitted, takes its place, so a reader's sample clock never stops and it can tell a keyup
/// from a gap.</para>
/// <para><b>Gaps.</b> Two kinds of loss are marked the same way. A slow reader's own queue
/// overflowing drops whole blocks, and the sample index jumps by exactly what was dropped. Audio
/// the input lost (<see cref="OnInputLost"/>, from <see cref="SoundModemChannel.ReceiveAudioLost"/>:
/// an overrun, a lost radio packet, a stalled input) never reached the channel at all and nobody
/// knows how much it was, so the index does not move for it; the gap flag alone says the two
/// sides of it are not one signal.</para>
/// <para><b>The requested band.</b> A connection may name a band it needs to hear
/// (<see cref="Client.Band"/>, set from the identify message); <see cref="BandRequested"/> fires
/// with the union of every connected band whenever that union changes, null when none is asked
/// for. What that is used for, widening a headless Flex's slice filter, is the caller's, not
/// this class's: it knows nothing about Flex.</para>
/// <para><b>Allocation.</b> Nothing on the receive thread allocates once a connection is open:
/// the block being gathered is one buffer, and each connection's queue is a ring of
/// preallocated blocks it copies into.</para>
