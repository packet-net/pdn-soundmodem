/// Binds an <see cref="ArdopArqEngine"/> to an <see cref="ArdopDemodulator"/> and
/// <see cref="ArdopModulator"/> under a single sample-count clock: one full-duplex
/// ARDOP station as a pure function of audio. Each <see cref="Step"/> consumes a block
/// of received samples and produces the same-sized block of transmit audio (silence
/// when idle), advancing the engine's clock by the block duration — so a hermetic test
/// runs whole sessions faster than real time from canned sample streams, and the live
/// path is the same code pumped by a sound-card duplex loop at its real rate. This is
/// the timing architecture the ARDOP design names as the Phase B risk control
/// (docs/ardop-design.md §7.1).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The engine's RX→TX turnaround (<see cref="ArdopTxRequest.NotBeforeMs"/>) is honoured
/// by emitting silence until the earliest start time; frame playout is contiguous once
/// started, and <see cref="ArdopArqEngine.TransmitCompleted"/> fires at the sample on
/// which the frame ends — the repeat window therefore opens exactly where ardopcf's
/// <c>SoundFlush</c> opens it.
