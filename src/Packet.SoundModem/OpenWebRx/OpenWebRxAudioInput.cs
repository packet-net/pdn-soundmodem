/// asks for one and the server applies it), its AGC, and its compression, which is the
/// receiver operator's choice and can be 4-bit ADPCM. The simulator measures what the ADPCM
/// costs each mode (<c>sm-ota sim --adpcm</c>); the AGC it cannot model, which is one reason
/// the on-air legs matter.</para>
/// <para><b>Sessions end and are picked up again</b> on <see cref="UberSdrReconnectPolicy"/>'s
/// ladder, the same one the UberSDR device uses: a session that delivered real audio is

/// ladder that never gives up, because only time lifts those. A receiver unreachable for
