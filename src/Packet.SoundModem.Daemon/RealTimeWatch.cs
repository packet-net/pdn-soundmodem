/// Compares the audio the receive loop is handed with the wall clock, and says when the station

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Why (issue #649).</b> GB7RDG's receive loop ran at about 0.3x real time for five days
/// (#648). The Flex input dropped the other 70 % of the audio and nothing said so: no journal
/// line, no metric, no warning on the page. The waterfall crawled and Listen chopped, and the
/// only place the loss showed was the raw-capture chunks, each holding 300 s of samples and
/// taking 16 minutes of wall clock to fill. A station that cannot keep up looks, from outside,
/// exactly like one on a quiet band.</para>
/// <para><b>What is measured.</b> Per <c>Read</c>, the samples delivered and the wall time since
/// the previous one, and of that time how much the loop spent processing rather than waiting in
/// <c>Read</c>. Over a window the first two give the share of real time that reached the
/// station; the third says why it fell short. Busy share over delivered share is the processing
/// the loop needed per second of audio. Audio lost on the way in leaves a loop that keeps up with
/// what does arrive, so that figure stays under one; a loop that is itself the bottleneck needs
/// more than a second per second, and whatever buffer the device has overflows. The two need
/// different fixes, so the line says which.</para>
/// <para>Busy share alone is not the test, though it was the first one: a thread starved of CPU
/// (a cgroup quota, a contended host) is descheduled inside <c>Read</c> as well as outside it,
/// so its busy share reads low. Measured on GB7RDG with a 15 % quota on 2026-10-10: busy 82 %,
/// 57 % delivered, which the first cut blamed on the network. 0.82 / 0.57 is 1.44 seconds per
/// second, the loop's fault, which it was.</para>
/// <para><b>What is left out.</b> Spans while this station is keyed (a keyed radio's receive
/// stream is not a measurement of anything) and while the host says the session is idle on
/// purpose (an on-demand receiver nobody is watching). Short dropouts inside a window do count:
/// they are lost audio. Long ones are the dead-feed watches' business, and they fire first.</para>
/// <para>Wall time comes from the station's <see cref="TimeProvider"/>, so the watch is testable
/// on a fake clock. The cumulative totals are read by the metrics endpoint from another thread
/// and are written with <see cref="Interlocked"/>; the window state belongs to the receive loop.</para>
