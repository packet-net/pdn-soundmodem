/// <remarks>
/// <para>This is the whole of the monitor's side of the seam for audio: a relayed station is an
/// ordinary station over a socket-fed input, with no modems, so the waterfall, the band overlays,
/// the browser audio and the page all come out of code that is already in production. See
/// <c>docs/uplink-plan.md</c> 3.2 and 4.1.</para>
/// <para><b>The buffer is bounded and drops the oldest.</b> Everything here arrives from another
/// machine over a socket this process does not control the pace of, and an unbounded accumulator
/// on such a path is the one thing the plan names as the pattern to avoid. When the buffer
/// overruns, the oldest audio goes: a late block is worth less than a live one to somebody
/// watching a waterfall, and a buffer that grew instead would turn a slow reader into a memory
/// leak with a display minutes behind the band.</para>
/// <para><b>A block is never half transmitted and half received.</b> The uplink labels each block
/// as heard or as the station's own transmission, and <see cref="Read"/> stops at a change of
/// kind rather than returning a mixture, so the flag it sets on the way out describes every
/// sample it returned. Reading and processing are the same thread
/// (<c>Station</c>'s receive loop), so the flag is exact rather than nearly right.</para>
