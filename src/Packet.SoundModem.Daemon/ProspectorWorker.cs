/// <para><b>Why a worker and not a call.</b> Reading one capture every way it might have been
/// sent is a couple of seconds of DSP for a couple of seconds of audio - trivial once, and not
/// trivial thirty times an hour on a Pi that is also demodulating four modems in real time. The
/// receive path must never wait for it and must never lose a slice to it.</para>
/// <para><b>How the throttle works.</b> One capture at a time, on one thread below normal
/// priority, and after each capture the worker sleeps for <see cref="Idle"/> times as long as
/// the sweep took. So the prospector's share of a core is bounded by construction rather than by
/// hoping the queue stays short - at the default it is a twentieth of one core, whatever the
/// station is hearing, and a slower box makes it slower rather than busier.</para>
/// <para><b>A backlog is dropped, not queued.</b> A station that suddenly hears a great deal is
/// a station whose CPU is already wanted elsewhere, and the captures are on disk: what is lost
/// is promptness, not evidence. The count is reported so the loss is visible.</para>
/// <para><b>The audio comes back off disk</b> rather than being handed over in memory. The
/// writer has just written it, so it is in page cache; and reading it back means this worker
/// holds no reference into anything the receive path allocated, which is the property that makes
/// "it cannot matter to the modems" checkable rather than argued.</para>
